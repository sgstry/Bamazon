This is a mock Amazon storefront NodeJS/MySQL application.
The application presents the user with all of the available products  that the store sells. The user is then able to select and item to purchase by id. The application then shows the user how much their purchase costs and if there are enough items in inventory. If there are enough items in the inventory, the application updates the database with the new stock quantity.
